# Email Spam Detection

## About the Project
This email spam model is a project outcome from conducting study research on IT security - Malware and attacker analysis. Email is one of popular media used by hacker to attack people. Attackers mostly send bulk spam emails to millions of targets just to hope that someone to fall for it. 
Thus, this project aimed to analyse the effectiveness of using the RNN model in categorizing email as spam or not. This email spam model is an outcome of a research study on IT security, focusing on malware and attacker analysis. Email is a commonly exploited medium for cyber attacks, with hackers frequently using it to target individuals. In these attacks, attackers often send massive volumes of spam emails to millions of potential targets, hoping that someone will fall victim.
As a result, this project aims to assess the effectiveness of utilizing an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) model in classifying emails as either spam or non-spam.
